your village's last goat
a packet of old love letters
a vial of dragon blood
a tungsten cube
an unidentified scroll
a prized locket
a handful of lint and hair
an ornate, ceremonial dagger
the ear of an orc
a glowing icosahedron
your last copper coin
a pinch of fairy dust
the eye of a basilisk
a single playing card face down
the tear of a harpy
a stack of unread mail
